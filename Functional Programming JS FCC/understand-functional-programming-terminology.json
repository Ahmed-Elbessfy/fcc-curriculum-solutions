{"index.js":"// Functional Programming: Understand Functional Programming Terminology\n// The FCC Team had a mood swing and now wants two types of tea: green tea and black tea. General Fact: Client mood swings are pretty common.\n\n// With that information, we'll need to revisit the getTea function from last challenge to handle various tea requests. We can modify getTea to accept a function as a parameter to be able to change the type of tea it prepares. This makes getTea more flexible, and gives the programmer more control when client requests change.\n\n// But first, let's cover some functional terminology:\n\n// Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.\n\n// Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.\n\n// The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.\n\n// When the functions are passed in to another function or returned from another function, then those functions which gets passed in or returned can be called a lambda.\n\n/**\n * A long process to prepare green tea.\n * @return {string} A cup of green tea.\n **/\nconst prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';\n\n/**\n * A long process to prepare black tea.\n * @return {string} A cup of black tea.\n **/\nconst prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';\n\n/**\n * Get given number of cups of tea.\n * @param {function():string} prepareTea The type of tea preparing function.\n * @param {number} numOfCups Number of required cups of tea.\n * @return {Array<string>} Given amount of tea cups.\n **/\nconst getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {\n  const teaCups = [];\n\n  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {\n    const teaCup = prepareTea();\n    teaCups.push(teaCup);\n  }\n\n  return teaCups;\n};\n\n// Add your code below this line\n\nconst tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea,27); // :(\nconst tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea,13); // :(\n\n// Add your code above this line\n\nconsole.log(\n  tea4GreenTeamFCC,\n  tea4BlackTeamFCC\n);"}
