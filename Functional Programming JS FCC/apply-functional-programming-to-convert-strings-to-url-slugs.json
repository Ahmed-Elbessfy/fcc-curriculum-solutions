We've also learned about reduce, which is a powerful method used to reduce problems to simpler forms. From computing averages to sorting, any array operation can be achieved by applying it. Recall that map and filter are special cases of reduce.\n\n// Let's combine what we've learned to solve a practical problem.\n\n// Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. For example, if you write a Medium post titled \"Stop Using Reduce\", it's likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (\".../stop-using-reduce\"). You may have already noticed this on the freeCodeCamp site.\n\n\n// Fill in the urlSlug function so it converts a string title and returns the hyphenated version for the URL. You can use any of the methods covered in this section, and don't use replace. Here are the requirements:\n\n// The input is a string with spaces and title-cased words\n\n// The output is a string with the spaces between words replaced by a hyphen (-)\n\n// The output should be all lower-cased letters\n\n// The output should not have any spaces\n\nconsole.clear();\n// the global variable\nvar globalTitle = \"Winter Is Coming\";\n\n// Add your code below this line\nfunction urlSlug(title) {\n  let splTitle = title.toLowerCase().split(/\\s+/);\n  return splTitle[0] === \"\" ? splTitle.slice(1,).join(\"-\") : splTitle.join(\"-\")\n}\n// Add your code above this line\n\nvar winterComing = urlSlug(globalTitle); // Should be \"winter-is-coming\""}
